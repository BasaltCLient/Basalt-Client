# Basalt-Client
Basalt Utility mod

Basalt Client is an old minecraft 1.16.5 utility mod that used to be paid  for 35 dollars at discord.
Client got leaked and taken down. After that clients sales are dropped and some people wanted refund.
As a joke i renamed it to Sigma5 so dont care about it.its not sigma
I Decided to make project Free cuz i dont have motivation to work on project anymore so no more updates
